# TYPEDOC TESTING

just a test repo to see how TypeDoc works with React+Webpack

Docs generated in docs/

`npm run docgen` to re-gen docs

Notes:
- Typescript Makes Doc Generation easy - since it has the parameter types etc in function sigs already
- Method/Function Signatures can be overriden if needbe
- TypeDoc generates a nice site with nifty search features - two different default themes, minimal (for small proj) and 'default' for medium to large. Theming can be customized if we want
- Directly supported by Microsoft, with plugins for Webpack/Gulp/Grunt
